🚀 Power BI Dashboard: Blinkit vs Zepto - Data-Driven Performance Comparison

 I recently developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that offers a detailed comparative analysis of two leading instant delivery platforms — Blinkit and Zepto.
 
🔍 Key Insights Featured:
📦 Product category trends across cities
💰 Price and quantity comparisons by brand
🕒 Delivery time performance benchmarking
⭐ Customer ratings and payment method analysis
📍 City-wise distribution and consumer behavior

📊 The dashboard was created using a custom dataset, highlighting actionable insights into customer preferences, operational efficiency, and product pricing strategies. This project showcases my skills in data modeling, DAX, and advanced visual storytelling through Power BI.

🧩 Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI | Excel | DAX | Data Cleaning & Transformation
